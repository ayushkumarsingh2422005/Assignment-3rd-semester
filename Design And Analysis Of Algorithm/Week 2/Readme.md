# Time Complexity of Search Programs

This repository contains C programs for performing Binary Search and Linear Search, along with their corresponding time complexities.

## Programs and Their Time Complexities

### Binary Search Program
- **Language:** C
- **Time Complexity:** `O(log(n))`
- **Description:** This program performs a binary search on a sorted array. The time complexity is logarithmic because the search space is halved with each iteration, making it efficient for large datasets.

### Linear Search Program
- **Language:** C
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Description:** This program performs a linear search on an array. The time complexity is linear because the program potentially checks each element of the array until the target element is found or the end of the array is reached.

## How to Run the Programs

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the desired program.
3. Compile the C file using a C compiler:
   ```sh
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name
